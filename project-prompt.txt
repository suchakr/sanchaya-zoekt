  "promptText": "I need an zoekt server that indexes my sanchaya github repo with text files in devanagri and other indic scripts and provides an login-less web ui that allows users to search the repo.  The app should have its own git repo. I need the app to be testable locally on dev mac and deployable on VM by pulling code from github and executing install/deploy scripts"
}

Create a self-hosted search application that indexes and provides full-text search capabilities for Indic language content from the Sanchaya GitHub repository, with the following specifications:

Core Requirements:
- Implement a Zoekt search server instance configured for Unicode/Indic script support
- Index all text files containing Devanagari and other Indic scripts from the Sanchaya repository
- Provide a public web interface for searching without authentication
- Support fuzzy search and relevant result highlighting
- Include READMEs in English for setup and usage

Development Environment:
- Must run on macOS for local development
- Include automated tests for core functionality
- Document dependencies and environment setup

Deployment:
- Provide shell scripts for automated installation and deployment
- Include configuration files for common VM environments
- Document system requirements and necessary permissions
- Support deployment via Git clone and script execution

Repository Structure:
- Maintain as a separate Git repository
- Include clear directory structure for server, web UI, and scripts
- Keep all source code in a single repository and keep folder as flat as possible
- Use a consistent naming convention for files and directories

Performance Requirements:
- Support concurrent searches
- Implement efficient indexing for large text files
- Include monitoring for server health

Documentation Deliverables:
- Local development setup guide
- Deployment instructions
- API documentation if applicable
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance tuning recommendations
